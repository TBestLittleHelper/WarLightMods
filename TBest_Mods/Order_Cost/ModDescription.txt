A player's income for the next turn, is reduced by 1 for each order they make this turn. The game creator can adjust a " free orders" parameter. For example, if you have 3 free order you want to make 1 deploy order and 2 attack orders, in order to have max income next turn.

The design goal of this mod, was to make excessive and tedious delay orders (moving 1 army around) a thing of the past. Now, you want to try to achive all your goals in the free order budget.
