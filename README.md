Before archving the repository, in favor of https://github.com/TBestLittleHelper/WarzoneMods , here is the status of the mods and code here

Mods that are considred completed.

Portals - Simple gimmick and no plans to add more features
LottoMod - An example mod, really
Bonus Overrider - It's a utility tool
Paratroopers
Group Chat - Is now a part of the base game. ( See below for city features ) 

[LocalDeployment](https://github.com/TBestLittleHelper/WarLightMods/tree/master/TBest_Mods/LocalDeploymentFixer) inspired a [version 2.](https://github.com/JustMe003/WarzoneMods/tree/main/Local_Deployment_Helper)

Might be fun to expand the concept :
Order Cost
Cost of An Empuire
Advancments
City Features ( Better cities. Does deserve a v2)
Group Chat : Has a version 2 in the new repository.
Zombie experiments : They are fun ideas, but hard to balance.
